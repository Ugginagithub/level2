/*Set Kth Bit
Program Description :
You are working on a computer program that deals with binary representations of numbers. Your task is to create a Python function set_kth_bit(N, K) that takes an integer N and a non-negative integer K as input. The function should set the Kth bit (counting from the right, starting with 0 as the least significant bit) in the binary representation of N to 1 if it's not already set, and return the modified integer.

Here are the function parameters:

N (integer): The input number whose binary representation needs modification.

K (non-negative integer): The position of the bit to set (0-indexed).

Your function should return the modified integer N with the Kth bit set.

Input Format :
A single line contains two numbers N and K.

Output Format :
Display the result number after making kth bit set.

Input :
16 2


Output :
20


Constraints :
1<= N <=10^6

1<= K <=32
