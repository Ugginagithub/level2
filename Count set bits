Count Set Bits
Program Description :
Count the set bits in a given number in its binary representation

Tevitt is Playing with number system and his teacher has given him a task to count Set Bits in the given number in its Binary Representation, help him to complete the task.

Input Format :
First line contains an integer Q which indicates the number of queries.

Next Q lines contains a number.

Output Format :
Display its respective count of Set Bits Binary Representation in Q lines.

Input :
3

#include <iostream>

int countSetBits(int num) {
    int count = 0;
    
    while (num > 0) {
        // Check the least significant bit
        if (num & 1) {
            count++;
        }
        
        // Right shift the number to check the next bit
        num >>= 1;
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int Q;
    std::cin >> Q;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {
        int N;
        std::cin >> N;
        
        int result = countSetBits(N);
        std::cout << result << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}


Constraints :
1<= Q <=1000

1<= N <=100000
