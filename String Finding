String Finding
Program Description :
You are developing a text analysis tool for a data processing application. The tool needs to determine whether a specific substring, "K," is present within a given string, "S." This functionality is crucial for identifying patterns and references within the text data.

Write a Python function "is_substring_present(S, K)" to check if the substring "K" is present in the string "S."

Here are the function parameters:

S (string): The input string in which you need to search for the substring.

K (string): The substring you want to check for in the input string.

Your function should return 1 if the substring "K" is found within the string "S," and 0 otherwise.

Input Format :
The first line contains a string S
The second line an substring K 

Output Format :
If substring K present in S print 1 else 0
 

Input :

codemind


Output :
1


Constraints :
1<=|S|,|K|<=10^5
