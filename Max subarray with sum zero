Max subarray With Sum Zero
Program Description :
You are working on a data analysis project that involves processing an array of integers. In this project, you need to find the maximum size of a subarray within the given array that has a sum equal to zero. Your task is to create a program that can calculate this maximum subarray size.

Problem Statement:

Write a program to find the maximum size of a subarray within an array arr of size N that has a sum equal to zero.

Input Format :
An integer array arr of size N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6), representing the elements of the array. The array can contain both positive and negative integers.

Output Format :
The program should return an integer, which is the maximum size of a subarray within arr that has a sum equal to zero.

Input :
8

15 -2 2 -8 1 7 10 23 


Output :
5


Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^5

-1000 <= A[i] <= 1000
