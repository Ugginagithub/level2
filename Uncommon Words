def uncommon_words(s1, s2):
    ws1 = s1.split()
    ws2 = s2.split()
    set_s1 = set(ws1)
    set_s2 = set(ws2)
    arr = list(set_s1.symmetric_difference(set_s2))
    arr.sort(key=lambda i: (i in ws1, i in ws2))
    return arr
s1 = input()
s2 = input()
res=uncommon_words(s2, s1)
print(" ".join(res))
