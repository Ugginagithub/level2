/*Climbing Stairs
Program Description :
You are working as a software developer for a fitness application that provides users with customized workout plans. You've been tasked with creating a function that calculates the number of distinct ways a person can climb a staircase. The catch is that the person can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time. This information is vital for generating workout plans that keep users engaged and motivated.

Problem Statement:

Write a function that calculates the number of distinct ways a person can climb a staircase with n steps, where they can choose to climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Input Format :
The function should accept a single integer input, n, representing the total number of steps in the staircase.

Output Format :
The function should return an integer, which is the number of distinct ways to climb the staircase.

Input :
2


Output :
2


Constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 45*/


def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
n=int(input())
result = climbStairs(n)
print(result)
