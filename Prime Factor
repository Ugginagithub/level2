/*Prime Factor
Program Description :
You are working on an application that requires finding the largest prime factor of a given number. This task is essential for optimizing various calculations within the application. Your job is to write a Python function largest_prime_factor(N) that can efficiently find and return the largest prime factor of a positive integer "N."

Here are the function parameters:

N (integer): The positive integer for which you need to find the largest prime factor.

Your task is to implement an efficient algorithm to find and return the largest prime factor of the given number "N."

Input Format :
A single line contains an integer N.

Output Format :
Print the greatest prime factor.

Input :
5


Output :
5


Constraints :
1 <= N <= 105*/
