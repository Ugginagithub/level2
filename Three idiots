Three Idiots
Program Description :
You are working on a problem related to mathematical expressions. In this scenario, you need to determine whether an expression of the form "x A y B z C" exists, where x, y, and z can be replaced by either addition or subtraction operations, and the final result of the expression is zero. Your task is to create a program that can determine if such an expression exists.

Problem Statement:

Write a program to check whether an expression of the form "x A y B z C" exists, where x, y, and z can be replaced by addition or subtraction operations (±), and the final result of the expression is zero.

Input Format :
An integer A (-10^9 ≤ A ≤ 10^9), representing the first number.
An integer B (-10^9 ≤ B ≤ 10^9), representing the second number.
An integer C (-10^9 ≤ C ≤ 10^9), representing the third number. 
Output Format :
The program should return a string:

Input :
2
