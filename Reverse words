/*Reverse words
Program Description :
You are a software developer working on a text-processing application. Part of your task involves creating a function that can reverse the order of words in a string while ensuring that the resulting string has a single space between words, even if the input string contains leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between words. This function is essential for improving the readability of text.

Problem Statement:

Write a program to reverse the order of words in a string, ensuring that the resulting string has a single space between words. The input string may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between words.

Input Format :
The program should accept a single input string s. The input string s can have leading or trailing spaces and may contain multiple spaces between words.

Output Format :
The program should return a string with the words in reverse order, where there is only a single space between words, and leading/trailing spaces or extra spaces between words are removed.
