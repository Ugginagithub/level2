Find The Number
Program Description :
You are a software engineer working on an e-commerce platform that needs to optimize product searches for users. The platform stores product information in sorted arrays, but due to data maintenance operations, these arrays may be rotated between 1 and n times. To improve search efficiency, you need to develop an algorithm that finds the minimum product price in a rotated sorted array of unique elements.

Problem Statement:

Write an algorithm to find and print the minimum element in a sorted, rotated array of unique elements. The goal is to achieve this in O(log n) time complexity to ensure efficient product searches on the e-commerce platform.

Input Format :
The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), representing the number of elements in the rotated sorted array.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the rotated sorted array.

Output Format :
The algorithm should print a single integer, which is the minimum element in the rotated sorted array.

Input :

11 13 15 17 


Output :
11


Constraints :
n == nums.length';p[
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
